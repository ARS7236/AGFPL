                       Version 1, 2025-12-27

 Copyright (C) 2025 ARS7236 <https://your-website-or-contact.info>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

 The ARS7236 General Freedom Public License (AGFPL) is a free, copyleft license
 for software and other works, based on the GNU GPLv3.

 AGFPL is designed to guarantee your freedom to share, use, and modify all
 versions of a program, and to ensure that freedom remains for all users.
 You can apply it to your programs, too.

 "Free" means freedom, not price. You may redistribute, charge for, or use the
 software however you like, as long as all recipients get the same freedoms
 you received, including access to source code and rights to modify and share.

                            TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 0. Definitions
   - "This License" = AGFPL v1.
   - "Program" = any copyrightable work licensed under AGFPL.
   - "You" = licensee. "Licensees" and "recipients" = individuals or organizations.
   - "Modify" = copy/adapt work in a way that requires copyright permission.
   - "Convey" = distribute or make the Program available to others.

 1. Source Code
   - You must provide the preferred form of the work for making modifications.
   - "Object code" = compiled or non-source forms.

 2. Basic Permissions
   - You can run, modify, and share the Program freely.
   - All rights granted are irrevocable as long as license terms are followed.
   - Output from running the Program is covered only if it constitutes a covered work.

 3. Conveying Verbatim Copies
   - You may share exact copies of the Program with copyright notice intact.
   - You must give all recipients a copy of this License.
   - You can charge any price or offer support for a fee.

 4. Conveying Modified Versions
   - You may share modified versions if you:
       a) Clearly mark changes and date them.
       b) License the whole work under AGFPL.
       c) Keep interactive interfaces showing appropriate legal notices (if applicable).

 5. Additional Permissions
   - You may add **extra non-restrictive permissions** to your version, such as:
       - Attribution requirements (“credit ARS7236 in documentation”)
       - Encouraging certain types of use (education, research, non-profits)
       - Any other fun or optional perks that **don’t remove freedoms**.
   - You cannot impose further restrictions that would contradict AGFPL.

 6. No Warranty
   - The Program comes “as-is” with **no warranty**.
   - You assume all risk for its use or modification.

 7. Patents
   - Contributors grant a royalty-free patent license for their contributions.
   - Patent licenses cannot be used to limit AGFPL freedoms.

 8. CMW (Creator Mention Work)
   - You must credit the original creator when using or sharing the work.
   - Example: “Credit: ARS7236” or “Origin: [PROGRAM link]”.
   - This applies to both verbatim and modified versions.

 9. Licensing
   - If you want to copyright your work, you **can do so safely**.  
   - You may **ask the original author to be included as a co-copyright author** (e.g., ARS7236).  
   - Any co-copyright agreement should be **mutually agreed and documented**.  
   - **No suing the original author**: You cannot take legal action against the origin author for this work; violations will be considered invalid and all rights revert against you.  
   - **Closing source rules**:  
       - You cannot fully close your open-source project for trivial or corporate reasons; only legitimate, documented reasons are acceptable.  
       - You **may close only sensitive files** (e.g., critical secrets or private configs), but the rest of the project must remain open.  
       - **Sus files rule**: Any files involved in scams, fraud, or other “sus” activity will automatically have their closed-source status revoked and must be fully open.  
       - **AI documentation rule**: Any documentation or reasoning claimed to be AI-generated will be declined as justification for closing source or restricting use.  

10. Abusing Rules
   - Any attempt to **bypass or cheat the rules of AGFPLv1** will be **declined and invalid**.  
   - This does **not** include bypassing the work itself for harmless/fun reasons (e.g., visual tweaks, fun bugs, personal experiments, easter eggs).  

11. Licenses
   - All rules of AGFPLv1 **also apply alongside GNU GPLv3**.  
   - When using or modifying a work under AGFPLv1, the GNU GPLv3 rules are automatically in effect as well.  
   - This ensures full legal compatibility and preserves all freedoms guaranteed by both licenses.  

12. How to Apply AGFPL to Your Programs
   - Add to top of each source file:
     <program name> – brief description
       Copyright (C) <year> ARS7236

                                          This program is free software: you can redistribute and/or modify
                                       it under the terms of the ARS7236 General Freedom Public License (AGFPL),
                                                         based on the GNU GPLv3 or later.

                                                                   NO WARRANTY.
