Copyright (C) 2025 ARS7236 @ARS7236 on social media (e.g., YouTube)
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

The ARS7236 General Freedom Public License (AGFPL) is a free, copyleft license
for software and other works, based on the GNU GPLv3.

AGFPL guarantees your freedom to share, use, and modify all versions of a program,
while ensuring that freedom remains for all users. You can apply it to your own programs.

"Free" refers to freedom, not price. You may redistribute, charge for, or use the
software however you like, as long as recipients enjoy the same freedoms you received,
including access to source code and rights to modify and share.

                          TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions
   - "This License" = AGFPL v1
   - "Program" = any copyrightable work licensed under AGFPL
   - "You" = licensee. Licensees/recipients = individuals or organizations
   - "Modify" = copy/adapt the work in a way requiring copyright permission
   - "Convey" = distribute or make the Program available to others

1. Source Code
   - You must provide the preferred form of the work for modifications.
   - "Object code" = compiled or non-source forms.

2. Basic Permissions
   - You may run, modify, and share the Program freely.
   - Rights are irrevocable as long as license terms are followed.
   - Output from running the Program is covered only if it constitutes a covered work.

3. Conveying Verbatim Copies
   - You may share exact copies with copyright notice intact.
   - All recipients must receive a copy of this license.
   - You may charge any price or provide support for a fee.

4. Conveying Modified Versions
   - You may share modified versions if you:
       a) Clearly mark modifications and date them
       b) License the entire work under AGFPL
       c) Maintain interactive interfaces showing legal notices (if applicable)

5. Additional Permissions
   - You may add extra, non-restrictive permissions, such as:
       - Attribution requirements ("Credit ARS7236 in documentation")
       - Encouraging educational, research, or non-profit use
       - Other optional perks that don’t remove freedoms
   - You cannot impose restrictions that contradict AGFPL.

6. No Warranty
   - The Program is provided "as-is", without any warranty.
   - You assume all risks from its use or modification.

7. Patents
   - Contributors grant a royalty-free patent license for their contributions.
   - Patents may not limit AGFPL freedoms.

8. Creator Mention Work (CMW)
   - You must credit the original creator when using or sharing the work.
   - Examples: "Credit: ARS7236" or "Origin: [PROGRAM link]"
   - Applies to both verbatim and modified versions.

9. Licensing
   - You may copyright your modifications safely.
   - You may ask the original author to be a co-copyright holder, with mutual agreement.
   - No suing the original author: legal action against the origin author is invalid; all rights revert against you.
   - Source closure rules:
       - You cannot fully close your open-source project for trivial or corporate reasons.
       - You may close only sensitive files (e.g., critical secrets), but the rest must remain open.
       - Sus files rule: files involved in scams, fraud, or "sus" activity must remain open.
       - AI documentation rule: AI-generated documentation or reasoning cannot justify closing source or restricting use.

10. Abusing Rules
    - Any attempt to bypass AGFPL rules will be declined and invalid.
    - This does not include harmless/fun bypassing of the work itself (e.g., visual tweaks, fun bugs, easter eggs).

11. Compatibility
    - AGFPL rules also apply alongside GNU GPLv3.
    - Using or modifying AGFPL works means GPLv3 rules are in effect, ensuring compatibility and full freedom.

12. How to Apply AGFPL
    - Add to top of each source file:
