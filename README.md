---

## Quick Overview

AGFPL is a **free, copyleft license** based on **GNU GPLv3 (or later)** with extra terms for creator credit and encouragement.  

**Key points:**
- **Credit the creator:** Always mention ARS7236 in README, about page, or startup banner.  
- **Modify & share:** You may change the program and distribute it under AGFPL.  
- **Optional extras:** You can encourage educational, research, or non-profit use.  
- **GPLv3 compatibility:** All AGFPL works are automatically under GPLv3 too.  

---

## Mandatory Rules

- You must include **CMW credit** for the original creator.  
  Example: `Credit: ARS7236` or `Origin: [PROGRAM link]`.  
- You must license modified versions under AGFPL.  
- All recipients must receive a copy of the AGFPL license.  
- No warranty is provided; you assume all risks from using or modifying the program.

## Recommendations / Spirit of the License

These are **strongly encouraged** but not legally enforceable:

- Respect the “freedom” of the project when closing any part of the source. Only sensitive files (critical secrets, configs) may be closed.  
- Avoid using AI-generated documentation as a justification for closing source.  
- Avoid “sus” or malicious activity with files; keep the work open and transparent.  
- Have fun with harmless modifications (visual tweaks, fun bugs, easter eggs) without violating freedom.
