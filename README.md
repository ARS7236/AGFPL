- Optional: Ask Original Creator of the work to be co-copyright author if you want
- No suing the original author
- You can close only sensitive files; most must stay open
- Sus/fraud files = automatically open
- AI-generated documentation = not valid
- Abusing the license itself = declined, but fun bugs/visual tweaks allowed
